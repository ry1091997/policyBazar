          <Text style={styles.description}>
            Policybazaar was founded in 2008 with one objective: bringing
            transparency in insurance. The founders wanted to reimagine
            insurance, so they started by simplifying all the information around
            plans, ending the rampant mis-selling, and preventing policy lapses.

            While we are happy with how we are changing insurance for the
            country, we know there is still a lot of work to be done. Our vision
            to bring pioneering technologies & innovations to the field
            continues to grow. We aspire to build a health & financial safety
            net for more households in India in the coming years.
